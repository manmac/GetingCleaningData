#DATA:

INPUT DATASET:
-------------------------------------------------------------

The input dataset includes the following files

>- 'README.txt'

>- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

>- 'features.txt': List of all features.

>- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

>- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

>- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

>- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

>- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

>- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

>- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

>- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

>- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

OUTPUT DATASET:

>-tidyData.txt

This is a dataset containing 180 observations of 68 variables.

The following are the columns of this dataset:

>subject - the person of interest (30 total subjects)

>activity - the activity name describing one of the following 6 activites:
>            1 WALKING
>            2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
>            3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
>            4 SITTING
>            5 STANDING
>            6 LAYING

>And the following 66 columns(in addition to above) describing the extracted measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

TRANSFORMATIONS:
-------------------------------------------------------------
> Step 0: This is a data prep stage. The data is downloaded from internet and saved in working directory in a file called: dataset.zip. This data is further extracted into the current working directory under a directory called : "UCI HAR Dataset" . We then reset the working directory to this directory for the duration of program.

> Step 1: Merges all training set into one dataset. The data in training set is read under ./train directory and the data in test set is read from ./test. rbind function is used to merge data. 

> Step 2: Read features.txt file and extract measurements  on the mean and stdev for each measurement. The resulting dataframe from this transformation stage is of 10299 observations and 66 variables.

> Step 3: Read activity_labels.txt and use activity names to name the activities in the data set. 

> Step 4: Appropriately  label the data set with descriptive activity names. gsub is used to remove brackets ("(" and ")") to clean column names.

> Step 5: Finally create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This tidy dataset is a dataset containing 180 observations of 68 variables. See section "OUTPUT DATASET" above for more details.

> Step 6: Reset back the current working directory to the state it was before the begining on the program.
